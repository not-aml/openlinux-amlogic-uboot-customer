This is an unofficial mirror of uboot customer files from Amlogic official OpenLinux site http://openlinux.amlogic.com:8000/download/ARM


The sources were uploaded here to mirror the tars from Amlogic site as git orphan branches for easy access.

Keep in mind that the public sources are usually old, outdated and developers working with Amlogic usually sign a SLA/NDA to gain access to Amlogic's private git server that serve more updated sources.


No support or development here!  
For official support contact Amlogic.


Currently, there's no OSS community effort to fix issues with Amlogic sources and update them.  
It will be nice to see OSS community effort and a proper linux-meson Github organization and repositories but as a non kernel developer I'm avoiding taking the first step myself.

If you find a more recent release on Amlogic site or in the wild, let me know by opening an issue.  
Please do not open an issue for anything else.
